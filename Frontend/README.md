# Lunoa - Main Frontend Application

This is the main user-facing decentralized application (dApp) for Lunoa, where users become **Adventurers** to explore, discover, and shape the world around them.

## The Adventurer's Experience

The application is built around a core user loop that combines real-world action with on-chain rewards and social gamification.

### Key Features

-   **Discover & Experience:** Users open the Lunoa app to explore a personalized map filled with nearby "Lunoas" — real-world places, events, and pop-up moments surfaced by an AI-powered engine. This is the primary interface for discovering what's happening around you.

-   **Check-In & Mint (Vibe NFTs):** When an Adventurer visits a location, they can “check in” and mint their moment as a **Vibe NFT**. This tokenized Real-World Asset (RWA) contains metadata, media (photos/videos), a timestamp, and geographic coordinates, serving as both a digital collectible and a verifiable cultural artifact.

-   **Adventurer’s Groups (Feed Groups):** Users can join or create themed **Feed Groups** — communities or guilds that curate quests, share exclusive Vibes, and run group challenges. These groups transform the quest feed into a vibrant, community-driven experience.

-   **Curate & Earn:** Valuable Vibes can be “boosted” by other users through `$Lunoa` micro-transactions. This system allows creators to earn tokens for their contributions, helps high-quality content gain visibility, and provides the platform with high-signal cultural data.

-   **Gamification via Quests:** Daily, weekly, and branded Quests guide user behavior (e.g., “Visit 3 indie cafés today,” “Join a DAO IRL meetup”), rewarding participants with `$Lunoa` tokens, NFT badges, and social reputation.

### Hackathon Deliverable Focus

Our Testnet dApp will showcase a slice of this user journey:

1.  **User Wallets & Vibe Minting:** Connect an Aptos wallet and mint a Vibe NFT.
2.  **Interactive Map:** View quests and activities on a map.
3.  **Token Faucet & Boost:** Use a faucet to get test tokens and demonstrate a micro-transaction by boosting a Vibe.
4.  **Decentralized Image URI:** The minted Vibe NFT will point to an image stored on a decentralized storage Testnet (e.g., Arweave), proving the DePin concept.
