# Changelog - 2025-07-16

## Backend

### Fixed
- **Quests Controller Tests**: Resolved critical issues causing Jest tests to hang and fail. The entire test suite was refactored to improve stability, isolate tests, and standardize mocking for the database connection and authentication middleware. This ensures reliable and consistent test runs.

## Aptos Smart Contract: Vibe NFT

This update delivers a fully functional and tested `vibe_nft.move` smart contract, enabling the creation and minting of Vibe NFTs on the Aptos blockchain. The process involved intensive debugging and verification to ensure correctness and align with the Aptos Object model.

-   **Contract Implementation (`vibe_nft.move`)**:
    -   Implemented `create_vibe_collection` and `mint_vibe_nft` functions using the `aptos_token_objects` framework.
    -   Resolved numerous complex compilation errors by identifying and targeting the correct `mainnet` revision of the Aptos framework dependencies.
    -   Corrected a fundamental logic error in resource handling, ensuring the `VibeCollection` marker resource is attached to the collection object itself, not the creator's account.

-   **Comprehensive Unit Testing (`vibe_nft_tests.move`)**:
    -   Developed a full test suite covering successful collection creation and NFT minting.
    -   Verified correct ownership transfer of the newly minted NFT to the recipient.
    -   Fixed test-specific errors related to string literal formatting in a Move test environment (`.to_string()` vs. `string::utf8(b"...")`).

-   **Build & Configuration**:
    -   Cleaned up all compiler warnings in the final code for improved quality and maintainability.

## Aptos Smart Contract: Core Quest Logic

This update marks a major milestone with the successful development and testing of the foundational `LunoaQuests` smart contract on the Aptos blockchain. The contract now supports the complete, basic lifecycle of a quest.

-   **Contract Implementation (`quests.move`)**: 
    -   Developed the core Move module with `Quest` and `QuestStore` structs to manage all on-chain quest data.
    -   Implemented three key entry functions: `create_quest`, `join_quest`, and `complete_quest`.
    -   Set up event handles for `QuestCreated`, `QuestJoined`, and `QuestCompleted` to enable off-chain services to listen to contract activity.

-   **Comprehensive Unit Testing (`quests_tests.move`)**:
    -   Built a robust test suite covering the entire quest lifecycle: creation, joining, and completion.
    -   Resolved multiple complex Move testing errors, including resource initialization, private function access, and correct test account setup.
    -   Implemented a test-only `view` function to allow tests to assert against the contract's internal state, ensuring logic correctness.

-   **Quests Smart Contract:** Implemented and tested a secure treasury and reward distribution mechanism. The contract now fully supports quest creation, joining, and completion with on-chain rewards.
-   **Quest Cancellation:** Added functionality for quest creators to cancel their quests and receive a full refund, with comprehensive tests.

-   **Build & Configuration**:
    -   Configured the `Move.toml` manifest with the necessary dependencies and named addresses for successful compilation and testing.

This update focuses on stabilizing the backend testing suite, fixing critical bugs in the quest and user controllers, and improving the reliability of the Aptos blockchain integration.

## Features & Fixes

-   **Quest Verification (`verifyQuestCompletion`)**:
    -   Successfully implemented a robust Jest test suite for the `verifyQuestCompletion` endpoint.
    -   Fixed all previously failing tests by correcting middleware mocking, resolving test timeouts, and preventing state leakage between tests.
    -   Refactored the controller to use the dynamic `reward_amount` from the quest details instead of a hardcoded value.
    -   Added comprehensive test coverage for success, error (403 Forbidden), and edge cases (e.g., participant status not 'submitted', user has no Aptos address).

-   **User Controller (`users.controller.ts`)**:
    -   Fixed a critical bug in the `getUserActivity` function where `userId` was used without being defined, causing runtime errors.

-   **Project Management**:
    -   Updated `Backend-Todolist.md` to accurately reflect the completion of the quest verification testing tasks.

## Technical Improvements

-   **Testing Framework**: Stabilized the Jest and Supertest environment by correcting the implementation and isolation of mocked middleware (`protect`).
-   **Code Quality**: Cleaned up redundant code in `users.controller.ts` and improved type safety in test files.
