# Lunoa - Business & Creator Dashboard

This dashboard is the command center for businesses, creators, and DAOs to participate directly in the Lunoa cultural economy. All interactions are designed to be fully on-chain, enabling a trustless and transparent environment.

## On-Chain Business Model

Lunoaâ€™s economic engine is built around the `$Lunoa` token and NFT-based primitives, allowing businesses to engage with customers in a Web3-native way.

### Key Features for Businesses & Creators

-   **Sponsored Quests:** Businesses can directly create and fund Quests on the blockchain. These are smart contracts that define reward logic, verification criteria (e.g., check-in at a specific location), and duration. This allows businesses to drive real-world traffic and engagement in a verifiable manner.

-   **Vibe Boosting & Analytics:** Businesses can boost their visibility on the platform and access analytics dashboards to understand foot traffic and engagement derived from their Quests. Premium features are unlocked via on-chain subscriptions paid in `$Lunoa` or stablecoins.

-   **Protocol-Native Merchant Quests:** The entire lifecycle of a quest is handled on-chain. Merchants deploy Quests via a factory contract, and all fees, rewards, and earnings are settled via smart contracts without intermediaries. This builds an on-chain reputation that can unlock further DeFi tools.

-   **Creator and Curator Incentives:** Creators can monetize their content through Vibe boosts and tips. Curators who run successful **Feed Groups** can also earn fees from engagement, creating a vibrant ecosystem of community-led discovery.

-   **DAO-Led Cultural Expansion:** The platform is designed to evolve into a protocol governed by regional DAOs. These DAOs can manage local quest curation, fund campaigns, and maintain local economic loops, giving communities true ownership over their cultural layer.

### Token Utility (`$Lunoa`)

The `$Lunoa` token is central to the dashboard's functionality:

-   **Quest Creation & Sponsorship:** Required to publish Quests and allocate rewards.
-   **Boosting & Tipping:** Used for micro-payments to creators and curators.
-   **Governance:** Token-weighted voting for Feed Groups and protocol-level decisions.
-   **Staking:** Stake `$Lunoa` to back high-reward Quests or participate in governing the decentralized recommendation AI.
